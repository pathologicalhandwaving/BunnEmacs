* Emacs-Shroud Interface
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ALT_TITLE: Introduction
  :DESCRIPTION: Shroud secrets manager
  :END:
  Shroud is a password manager written in Guile which uses GnuPG in
  the backend. See Shroud's website at [[https://dthompson.us/projects/shroud.html][this link.]] This package is an
  Emacs interface to Shroud using the Buffers User Interface library.

  Shroud stores secrets as a plain text encrypted using
  GnuPG. Particularly, in Lisp's S-expressions, in a form of
  associaton lists. This provides the dual benefit that, the file is
  trivial to parse by machine, yet at the same time, is perfectly
  readable/editable by a human.

  You can view, copy and edit secrets from Emacs.

* Installation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ALT_TITLE: Installation
  :DESCRIPTION: This section will guide you through setting up Shroud.el
  :END:
** with guix
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ALT_TITLE: Install with Guix
   :DESCRIPTION: Using the Gnu Guix package manager
   :END:
   To install, simply clone the repo, or download file =guix.scm= and
   build the package =emacs-shroud= present in =guix.scm=.
   #+begin_src shell
    git clone https://github.com/o-nly/emacs-shroud.git
    cd emacs-shroud
    guix package -i guix.scm
   #+end_src
** from git
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ALT_TITLE: From Sources
   :DESCRIPTION: Install from Git
   :END:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (push (directory-file-name "/path/to/emacs-shroud/") load-path)
    (require 'shroud)
   #+end_src
** from Melpa
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ALT_TITLE: From Melpa Package Repository
   :DESCRIPTION: Install from Melpa
   :END:
   The easiest way to install is to use MELPA, and just type:
   =M-x package-install RET shroud= inside Emacs.

* Configuration
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ALT_TITLE: Configuration
  :DESCRIPTION: Pick some options, set variables
  :END:
  Shroud's configuration options can be changed in the =$HOME/.shroud=
  file. The default database is located in =~/.config/shroud/db.gpg=.

  However, Emacs-shroud also includes an elisp implementation of
  Shroud. It can be configured to use the same defaults as Shroud.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq shroud-el--database-file "~/.config/shroud/db.gpg")
    (setq shroud-el--config-file "~/.shroud")
    (setq shroud-el--gpg-key "user@example.com")
  #+end_src
  If gpg-key is not set and no configuration file is found Shroud may
  prompt you to choose a key each time you edit the database(remember
  it's just alists)
  You can choose to use the elisp implementation only with this bit of Elisp.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq shroud-executable nil)
    (shroud--init)
  #+end_src
  If the shroud-executable is nil shroud--init will setup accordingly.
